"""Parallelizing compiler launcher for HIP.

This script parallelizes HIP compilations by splitting device and host compilations
out into individual processes. Compile times are potentially improved by splitting
the work into smaller tasks. It is mainly effective when the object files of a
project have very different compile times, and compile for many different HIP
architectures at the same time.

To use the script, simply prepend it to your compile command. For example:

  $ phc.py hipcc -c -o test.o test.hip --offload-arch=gfx1201 --offload-arch=gfx942

Note that parallel compilation is only activated when (1) an object file is compiled
(by passing -c), and (2) multiple explicit --offload-arch= options are passed to the
compiler.

Additionally, this script is designed to work under a GNU Make Jobserver, such as the
one launched by GNU Make. Ninja >= 1.13 also integrates with a GNU Make Jobserver, but
it does not launch its own server. In order to use the script with CMake, use a custom
jobserver, for example jobserver_pool.py from the Ninja misc scripts[0]. The easiest way
to use the script with CMake is to pass it as CMake HIP compiler launcher, using
-DCMAKE_{CXX,HIP}_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=/path/to/phc.py.

tl;dr:
  $ cmake [...] \
    -GNinja \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=/path/to/phc.py \
    -DCMAKE_HIP_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=/path/to/phc.py
  $ /path/to/ninja/misc/jobserver_pool.py ninja
